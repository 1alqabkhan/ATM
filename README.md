# ATM
ATM is a python program to perform simple atm task.It operates on the pin, balance.  
It uses the class, method, constructor,etc.

For more code break down:

1 -> I set Atm as a class. 
2 -> I define "__init__" function known as dunder. It is constructor, It automatically execute when any object from a class is use.
It contain pin and balance which is different with respect to their object.
3 -> In "instruction" function I take input and check condition by "If-else" statement.
